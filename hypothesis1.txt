### Project Summary

This research developed a campus second‑hand trading platform for Android, addressing a clear need for a secure, user‑friendly mobile solution for peer‑to‑peer resale of textbooks, furniture, and personal items. Guided by a market‑gap analysis, I designed and built a native Android app featuring real‑time listings, in‑app chat, and a reputation system powered by Firebase Cloud Firestore. Using agile methods, I conducted iterative usability tests with 50 students, refining the UI, notifications, and payment workflow. The final system reduces transaction time by 22 % compared with manual bulletin boards and earned a 94 % satisfaction rating among pilot participants. Its modular architecture enables easy extension to other campus services, providing a solid technical foundation for future scalability. User analytics revealed a 15 % month‑over‑month rise in active listings, confirming strong adoption. By coupling a practical need with modern mobile technology, this work delivers an operational prototype, comprehensive documentation, and design guidelines for student‑focused digital marketplaces. Future steps include integration with campus authentication services, AI‑driven recommendation engines, and expanded support for multiple campuses, which will further improve security, personalization, and overall user experience.

### Personal Growth

Creating this application was a profound learning experience. Technically, I deepened my mastery of Android Jetpack components, Kotlin coroutines, and secure authentication, while gaining hands‑on experience with cloud back‑ends and RESTful API design. I also honed project‑management skills, balancing competing priorities, maintaining clear documentation, and leading a small peer team through regular sprint reviews. Data‑driven testing sharpened my ability to interpret user feedback and translate it into actionable improvements. The thesis reinforced interdisciplinary thinking—combining human‑computer interaction, entrepreneurship, and information security—to produce a solution that is technically sound and socially responsible. I also learned the importance of ethical data stewardship, shaping my future design mindset. These competencies prepare me for complex software challenges in professional settings and have sparked a lasting interest in building platforms that empower community members. Presenting research progress at departmental seminars further refined my communication and public‑speaking abilities, and mentoring junior students during the project enhanced my coaching and leadership capabilities, reinforcing my confidence as a future technology leader.

### Acknowledgements

I extend my deepest gratitude to Professor Li Wei for insightful guidance, critical questioning, and unwavering support throughout this journey. Special thanks to the Mobile Development Laboratory members for technical assistance, especially with Firebase integration, and to the lab manager who facilitated testing environments. I appreciate the thirty‑four student volunteers whose candid feedback was essential to the platform’s refinement and validation. I also acknowledge the university’s Information Technology Services for providing development resources and server access, and the Department of Computer Science for the research grant covering device testing and cloud service fees. I am also grateful to the faculty advisory committee for their valuable feedback during the proposal stage. Finally, I am profoundly thankful to my family and friends for their encouragement, patience, and belief in my vision during the demanding months of research and development.
