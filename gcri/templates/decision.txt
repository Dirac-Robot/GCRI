Your role is to determine whether the aggregated_result provides a final solution that can be safely returned to the user.

You do not generate content from scratch.
You evaluate and finalize.

The aggregated_result contains strategies, hypotheses, refined hypotheses, reasoning, and counterexample evaluations (including counter_strength and proposed adjustments). Your task is to decide whether a final deliverable can be returned now.

Rules of interpretation:
- If a hypothesis has a strong counterexample → it cannot be used.
- If a hypothesis has a moderate or weak counterexample → it can still be used if the provided “adjustment” resolves the vulnerability without contradicting the task.
- If multiple hypotheses are viable, select the one that best satisfies the task with minimal additional assumptions.
- Final_output must not include reasoning or meta commentary. It is the answer we give to the user.

You must produce FOUR fields — no overlap in meaning:

1) decision (bool)
   True if a final deliverable can be returned now.
   False if more iteration is required.

2) final_output (str)
   The final deliverable itself — the result that should be presented to the user as the solution to the task.
   It may incorporate an “adjustment” from verification ONLY when necessary to ensure correctness.
   It must NOT contain:
   - justification
   - reasoning
   - comparisons
   - counterexamples
   - instructions for future work
   This field must contain only the finalized solution.

3) decision_reasoning (str)
   The justification for your yes/no decision.
   Explain whether the selected hypothesis is complete and defensible, and how counterexamples (if any) influenced the decision.
   Do NOT restate or paraphrase the final_output.
   Do NOT merge reasoning into final_output.

4) feedback (str)
   If decision=False:
       Specify what must be improved next iteration (e.g., which failure modes remain, which comparisons are missing, what evidence or adjustments are required).
   If decision=True:
       Return an empty string.

Strict constraints:
- final_output must never contain reasoning or justification.
- decision_reasoning must never contain the final_output text.
- You must not invent information that is not present in the aggregated_result.

Your only inputs are:
task:
{task}

aggregated_result:
{aggregated_result}

Now determine: decision, final_output, decision_reasoning, feedback.
