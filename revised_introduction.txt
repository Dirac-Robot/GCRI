The rapid proliferation of digital technologies—5G, big data, cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and blockchain—has transformed urban development from a static planning exercise into a dynamic, data‑driven ecosystem commonly referred to as the smart city [1][2]. In China, a series of national and local policy documents have been issued to accelerate this transition, urging municipalities to leverage information infrastructure to enhance governance efficiency, public‑service quality, and residents’ well‑being [3][4]. Despite notable achievements in pioneering cities such as Shanghai and Hangzhou, the majority of Chinese cities continue to confront three inter‑related challenges: persistent data silos that hinder real‑time information sharing, fragmented cross‑departmental collaboration, and the lack of robust supervision and performance‑assessment mechanisms.

Addressing these challenges is of strategic significance. Effective data integration can unlock the latent value of municipal information assets, fostering evidence‑based decision‑making; seamless inter‑agency collaboration can accelerate response to urban events and improve social governance; and systematic monitoring can ensure that digital interventions translate into tangible improvements in service delivery and citizen satisfaction. Consequently, a comprehensive construction plan that couples top‑level design with concrete institutional mechanisms is essential for realizing an intelligent, citizen‑centric urban environment.

This paper pursues three research objectives: (1) diagnose the root causes of data fragmentation and coordination bottlenecks in current smart‑city initiatives; (2) propose a unified framework—comprising a trustworthy cloud‑based urban foundation, a consolidated data hub, a capability hub, and an integrated application‑and‑operation layer—that supports “unified management, unified service, and unified collaboration” across governmental units; and (3) delineate concrete policy and mechanism recommendations to promote data sharing, value extraction, and performance assessment.

The contributions of this work are threefold. First, it synthesizes best‑practice experiences from leading Chinese smart cities and articulates the systemic gaps that impede broader adoption. Second, it introduces a modular architecture that aligns technical infrastructure with governance processes, enabling scalable and interoperable solutions. Third, it offers actionable institutional guidelines—such as unified data‑resource ledgers, standardized urban‑event classifications, and quantifiable performance indicators—to motivate governmental departments to share data, co‑create services, and continuously improve urban‑operation outcomes. By bridging technological capability with governance reform, the proposed plan aspires to accelerate the transition toward smart, resilient, and people‑oriented cities.
