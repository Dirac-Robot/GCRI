Validate by running reproduce.sh on a small test subset (e.g., 1‑epoch training) and compare quick metrics to the paper's reported trends, adjusting hyper‑parameters if needed.

For each contribution, perform focused web searches for publicly available open‑source implementations of similar ideas (e.g., GitHub repos, tutorials). 3. Evaluate each candidate implementation for licensing compatibility and similarity to the described method. 4. Fork or adapt the most suitable candidate, rewriting any portions that would replicate the authors' exact code, and integrate it into a new /home/submission project using `write_file`. 5. Incrementally build a `run_experiment.py` script that loads the adapted component, runs a reduced‑scale version of the experiment (e.g., subset of data, fewer epochs), and writes metrics to CSV. 6. Compose reproduce.sh to orchestrate environment setup, dependency installation, execution of run_experiment.py for each core experiment, and aggregation of results. 7. Use addendum.md to resolve any missing details (hyper‑parameters, data preprocessing steps) that were moved to the appendix. 8. Prioritize reproducing the experiments emphasized in the abstract/introduction; defer lower‑impact figures if time runs out. 9. After each experiment, compare trend lines (e.g., accuracy vs. epochs) to the paper’s reported curves, noting acceptable deviation ranges in the README.

Success means each strategy clearly outlines a plausible, non‑overlapping reasoning path that a downstream implementation agent can follow to (1) identify the paper's primary experiments and results, (2) prioritize them according to importance (using rubric.json if present), (3) design a reproducible code base (including a reproduce.sh script, README, and necessary source files) that respects all constraints (no blacklisted resources, repository size ≤1 GB, GPU usage, relative paths), and (4) plan validation steps to ensure generated results match the original trends within a reasonable margin. The strategies must not contain actual code or data, only guidance, and must explicitly require using the `write_file` tool for any file creation.
